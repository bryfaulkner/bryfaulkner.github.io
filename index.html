									<h2>Featured Story at Virginia Tech</h2>
									</header>
									
												<p>
												While in high school, I was diagnosed with a learning disability. 
												After reaching out to others, following my diagnosis, I was able to receive appropriate accommodations. 
												These accommodations do not provide me an advantage over my fellow classmates, rather they help to "<i>level the playing field.</i>"
												</p>

												<p>
												As a student at Virginia Tech, 
												I still receive and utilize accommodations with approval from the <a href="http://www.ssd.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Services for Students with Disabilities</a> 
												office of the <a href="http://www.dsa.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Division of Student Affairs</a>. They have been a fantastic resource and they are fantastic people, too.</p>
												
												<p>
												If you seem to struggle with testing, or successfully completing tasks on-time, whether at VT or elsewhere, 
												never be afraid to ask for help. If you have a moment, and would like to learn more, 
												please see my featured Virginia Tech article by clicking the link below. 
												Also, I’d be happy to try and answer any questions you may have/direct you to appropriate contacts.. 
												please feel free to contact me anytime <a href="mailto:bryanf81@vt.edu">(bryanf81@vt.edu)</a>.

									<h2>My First Publication</h2>
									</header>

									
									<p>Ever since I began my engineering studies at Virginia Tech, I have had a great passion for research. A large part of research involves reading/studying Master's Theses, Ph.D. Dissertations, and various conference and journal publications. For years I have dreamed of being an author. Now I finally am an author!  It is a privilege and an honor to be a co-author on a paper being presented at the premier global event in my field - the 31st Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference & Exposition, to be held in Long Beach, California next March.  After 3 months of waiting, our paper was accepted by the review committee yesterday.  I can't wait to share our work with the world! </p>

												<ul>
												<li>Over two years of experience with AC & DC circuit design and theory</li>
												<li>Almost two years of C/C++ and MATLAB embedded programming experience</li>
												<li>Verilog HDL based work executed with FPGAs</li>
												</ul>
												</p>
												<p>As a member of The Engineering Honor Society, <a href="http://www.tbp.org/">Tau Beta Pi</a>, and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Honor Society, <a href="http://www.hkn.org/">IEEE-HKN</a>, I continually strive to advance my understanding of the engineering profession, and seek to give back to my community, in any way possible.</p>


												<h4 id="ri">Research Interests</h4>

												<ul>
												<li>Power Electronics</li>
												<li>Configurable and Wearable Computing </li>

												</ul> 


												<p>I desire to enter into Graduate School for an advanced Electrical Engineering Degree.  I am currently on track to successfully enter into the <a href="http://www.ece.vt.edu/graduate/uggprog.html">Undergraduate/Graduate</a> degree program, offered through the ECE Department.  I am planning on pursuing my Master's of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE), with a concentration in Power Electronics.  Starting Spring 2016, I will begin taking 5000-level classes that will double count towards my final requirements of my Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE), and my beginning requisite MSEE classes.</p>



												<!--<a href="http://www.tbp.org/">Tau Beta Pi</a>-->

												<p>Apart from research, I have really grown in my own faith, while in college, and I have actively helped others seek out and grow in their own faith life.</p>

												<p>For the past two years, I have been actively involved in the leadership of the <a href="http://vtcatholic.com">Newman Community - Catholic Campus Ministry at Virginia Tech.</a>
