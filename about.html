  <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
  <p>In 2013 I completed bachelor of science degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics
at Virginia Tech and liked the place well enough to stay a while longer.
Currently, I’m a PhD student working on Machine Learning and Computer Vision with
<a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/">Dhruv Batra</a> – also at Virginia Tech.
Check out my <a href="#ri">research interests</a> below and <a href="/2015/03/15/whyai/">this essay</a>
I wrote to find out more about what I do.</p>

<p>Apart from research, I’ve been an active fencer since 2005, competing in
club collegiate tournaments and USFA events (mostly in the
<a href="http://va-usfa.com/">Virginia Division</a>). The last time I updated this
page I was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fencing_Association#Ratings">C2014</a> in foil. Check out the
<a href="http://www.fencing.org.vt.edu/">VT fencing page</a> if you’re interested in
fencing at Virginia Tech.</p>

<h1 id="ri">Research Interests</h1>

<p>I want to scale the ability of Machine Learning toward AI by developing models
that encompass an increasing amount what we call intelligence. That’s hard,
and I can only do a small part of it. In particular, I’m
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWNBzAgAiMc">focusing</a> on Deep Learning
(today’s neural networks) with applications to Computer Vision (vision).</p>

<p>I suppose I’m something like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism">connectionist</a>.
I want to design modules and connect them together in a way that improves
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">neural networks</a>.
Hopefully this involves experimentation and theory, each pushing the other
to new heights as is often the case in science.</p>

<p>Currently I focus on vision for a couple reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I like to think visually, so I find vision problems intuitive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s an active vision community which is integrated with the ML community
and serves as a great melting pot for ideas as well as a place I can go
to figure out which ideas are good and which are bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Vision problems are complex.</em> Start by building parts of intelligent
systems and gradually understanding those, but eventually you need to connect
the parts to build a system that’s not singly focused. <sup id="fnref:parts"><a href="#fn:parts" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
To do (my kind of) vision, one must recognize patterns in images then connect
those patterns with other knowledge to form new patterns <sup id="fnref:complex_vision"><a href="#fn:complex_vision" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Vision problems are simple.</em> Somehow, vision seems like a smallest
possible subset of intelligence that maintains the above complexity.
Animals can replicate a significant amount of the human visual system, but
they tend not to be able to do things like write and speak language.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m still fairly new to the field, so all this could change in a couple years :)</p>
